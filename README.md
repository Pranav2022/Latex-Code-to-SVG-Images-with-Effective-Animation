# Latex-Code-to-SVG-Images-with-Effective-Animation
Our team github Link : Team Evelopers - https://github.com/Team-Evelopers/Team-Evelopers-team_evelopers_latex_to_SVG
Introduction : 
    • An User Interface would be developed using Web Technologies and
    Docker .
    • The latex code shared by the user would be processed through Docker
    and corresponding SVG/JPG/PNG image will be generated.
    • The SVG/JPG/PNG image will be animated in the last phase .

Our system is a remote learning tool that is used for academic presentation and e-learning coursework material. 
Take Latex equation and convert it to a demonstration ready video or presentable slide. 
This system is developed only to generate SVG from latex and then SVG to animated SVG. In addition, it will identify each component of SVG using machine
learning model through classification

Our system is divided into 3 modules. The very first module is conversion of latex equation or code to SVG image. At this stage, user will
give input to the system and it will be converted to SVG image format for
further process. Our frontend system where user will provide input is built
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In Second module there is handwritten
character identification using Machine learning and in the third mudule we
will be animating the SVG images.

Tools and Technologies Used
• Frontend (HTML,CSS and Javascipt): For designing frontend
part we have used HTML, CSS and Javascript. With the help of cascading style sheets we have designed our website
• Docker: Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OSlevel virtualization to deliver software in packages called contain- ers.
The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the
containers is called Docker Engine.We have used docker for converting
latex code to SVG images.
• TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library
for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across
a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference
of deep neural networks. For Handwritten character identification we
have used Tensorflow.
• Convolutional Neural Network: A Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly wellsuited for image recognition and processing tasks. It is made up of
multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully
connected layers.In Handwritten character identification we have used
this method.
• Additional Libraries and Frameworks: Various additional libraries
and frameworks were used to enhance the implementation process.
